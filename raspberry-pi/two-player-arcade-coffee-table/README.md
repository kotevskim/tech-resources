Modern gaming consoles are fun and all, but nothing beats playing a classic game on an arcade machine. Unfortunately, arcade machines can cost a pretty penny, some even as much as US$500. The good news is that with your Raspberry Pi, you won't need to shell out hundreds of bucks just to experience the nostalgia and charm of old-school games. This [Two-Player Arcade Coffee Table](https://www.instructables.com/RasPi-Two-Player-Arcade-Coffee-Table/), explained by a user solargarlic on Instructables, brings the arcade right into your living room for way less (as low as $50). All it requires is a Pi board, monitor, and speakers (which you likely have at home), some pieces of wood (hello, upcycling old furniture), and an arcade DIY kit with a USB encoder (snag one for less than $50 on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WAY9848/?tag=slashgearcom-20)!).

The Pi-based arcade coffee table is powered by the RetroPie software that enables you to play a vast variety of games, including those from Playstation, Nintendo (NES), Super Nintendo (SNES), and SEGA (though you'd need to source the games yourself). The project is also designed with two players in mind, so you and your family member or guest can simultaneously enjoy. What's great about this DIY project is that you won't need to be a coding wizard as all you need to do is download and install a [pre-made RetroPie image](https://retropie.org.uk/download/) to your board and then load it up with your favorite games (here's a [tutorial](https://www.raspberrypi.com/tutorials/retropie-raspberry-pi-tutorial/) on how to do that). The real challenge might be building the coffee table and mounting the electronics inside (prepare your woodworking skills).
