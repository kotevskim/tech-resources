Fed up with your indoor plants dying on you but aren't keen on spending on a fancy automatic watering device? There's actually a budget-friendly way to keep your plants thriving without your constant attention, thanks to the handy-dandy Raspberry Pi. This Automated Plant Watering System takes the task of watering your green friends off your hands by doing it automatically. It makes use of a capacitive soil moisture sensor that's plunged into your plant's soil and constantly checks if it's time for a drink. Once it detects that the soil is dry, the system kicks a submersible pump into gear, drawing water from a container straight to your potted plant.

This DIY project also comes complete with a Flask web server, where you can control the system remotely from a web browser. It offers some nifty control buttons that let you toggle the auto-watering on or off, check the soil status, manually water the plant once, and display the last time the plant was watered. Aside from the Raspberry Pi, each of the components you need for this project only costs $10 or less, amounting to roughly $30.
