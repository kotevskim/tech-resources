## Micro-habits
Narrow down the list to things you can actually accomplish, with acrucial element: when, where, and how. 

Be specific:  
Before:   
As a fitness enthusiast, I had always neglected the important practice of drinking enough water, even after suffering injuries.
Every night, I found myself thinking, "tomorrow, I'll make sure to drink more water." But tomorrow never came. So, I took a different approach.  
After:  
I put a three-liter water bottle on my desk, where I could see it all the time. I sipped some water after every call, and within a few days, I could hit my target of drinking three liters a day. 
I saw a difference in my energy levels, and my skin looked clearer.

## Follow the one-minute rule

Gretchen Rubin, author of "The Happiness Project," wrote: "One simple way to stay on top of things is to take care of tasks that take less than a minute to complete immediately. This might mean recycling junk mail, hanging up your coat, responding to a text, closing a silverware drawer, or screwing the lid on a jar of peanut butter."

These small tasks may not seem like much on their own, but they can quickly add up and become overwhelming if we put them off, such as arranging the living room or washing the dishes.

By tackling them right away, we can avoid the negative cycle of procrastination and prevent the build-up of additional responsibilities.

When it comes to arranging the living room, or leaving dirty dishes at night, I remind myself daily, "If I can't do it today, what makes me think I am going to do it tomorrow?"

I experienced more peace and zen with this micro habit because I don't have to frown about cleaning and dusting every weekend.

## Park the car 1,000 yards away from your home or office

The benefits of walking are not new to us but our sedentary lifestyles don't allow us to walk too often.

According to [a study](https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1479-5868-8-79), walking 10,000 steps a day is a "reasonable target" for adults trying to stay healthy. 

Parking your car 1,000 yards from your home or office can add up to almost 3,000 steps. 

After adopting this micro habit, I could reach the 10,000 mark almost every day. This achievement boosted my self-confidence.

## Make your bed before you get your morning coffee

Making your bed before you get your morning coffee seems like a micro habit, but it gives you a sense of accomplishment and pride.

Small wins [boost your productivity](https://www.businessinsider.com/ways-to-be-more-productive-manage-time-better-experts-2018-12) and encourage you to do another task to perfection.

By the end of the day, you'll feel those little things elevate your bad mood.

## Count to 10 before replying to out-of-the-blue questions

We often regret saying things that we aren't supposed to. Red-faced, we try to make amends to make things right and waste a significant part of our energy and time.

So, whenever someone comes up with an out-of-the-blue question, instead of blurting out some nonsense, stay paused for at least 10 seconds. You'll get some time to think about an appropriate answer.

You can even drop something like a pen or paper, so the time you pick it up, you get a chance to think.

Make it a habit by any means so that you don't reply instantly, even unconsciously. Hold onto your tongue for 10 seconds to avoid a slip of the tongue. This micro habit could save a lot of unnecessary mental stress.

## Review your goals at least once a day

[Revising our goals](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-make-a-plan-for-your-goals-2020-6) helps us stay connected to our motivation, create new plans and accommodate any changes in our lives. 

This way, we don't get disillusioned by other priorities and stay focused on what we really want.

Remember, big goals, lofty goals, and big results don't need great habits — just staying aware of what you have to do.

## Think of one good thing about your day

Positive and negative things can happen during the day. But most of the time, we hold onto the negative thoughts and repeat them in our minds. We sleep thinking about it, and when we wake up, the same negativity bothers us.

I made a strict rule for myself to focus only on the positives.

I try to count as many positives as I can from my day. I hardly remember if I stay awake after this.

This feeling of fulfillment improved my sleep quality. Not only do I sleep well, but I also wake up in an energized and cheerful mood.

## Never go to bed with a dirty kitchen

Having a clean and tidy kitchen before bedtime will give you peace of mind, and keep your home free from pests and other contaminants.

Plus, you'll feel more organized and ready to tackle the next day's tasks.

## Banish screens from the dining area

We are so busy on our phones and laptops that we have lost the joy of eating. We check our work emails and messages or post updates on social media during meals.

But this type of multitasking is killing us slowly, as it leads to overeating and other health issues. I created a boundary for myself not to use any electronic device during a meal.

This [helped me stay stress-free](https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/mental-health/stress-relief), focus on what I eat, and be more mindful of my eating habits. It also gave me time to talk and share moments with family or friends while having meals.

A bonus point: I lost some extra pounds too.

## Mute all notifications

The blue screen on our smartphones is like a magnet, which attracts us no matter what we are doing.

Muting all the notifications from social media and other applications can help save time and energy to stay focused on what matters the most. It can also reduce feelings of [anxiety, depression](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-talk-to-your-boss-about-your-mental-health-2018-9), and stress.

It helps us stop comparing our lives with others, and instead focus on self-improvement and growth.

So take a break from the virtual world and start living in the moment.
